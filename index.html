<h1>glommerZ helps you find free food with no moral questions</h1>
<p>Let's say you want some food but you don't feel like paying. You let <strong>glommerZ</strong> help you find it by specifying your zip code and the day you want to find free food.<br/> <strong>glommerZ</strong> will point you to a list of places to get free food in your locale and <em>give you tips for getting the food.</em></p>
<p>Let's say you pick free food given by a rodeo association. We'll tell you that you don't have to wear jeans and that you can mention you love Tennessee Walking Horses. We'll point you to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Walking_Horse"> Wikipedia</a> entry where you can learn enough to show people you're not that much into rodeos but you could pass.  Okay now you are in. Scarf the food and just make a beeline for the door.<p>
<p>Don't tell the people giving the food that you're here from <strong>glommerZ</strong> or the free food will stop for all.</p>
<h2>Best of luck in your new adventures</h2>
<em>The glommerZ staff</em>
